# Optimizing Stiffness Distribution of MDOF Structures

A chief goal in seismic engineering is to minimize the potential for extreme damage in a structure during an earthquake. One predictor of damage in a building is the interstory drift ratio (IDR), which is a measure of the relative displacement between two stories. This paper discusses methods to find the optimal distribution of story stiffnesses in a multiple-degree-of- freedom (MDOF) structure in order to minimize the peak IDR under seismic loading. This optimal stiffness distribution could represent the optimal height to place lateral force braces in a multistory structure. Three proposed optimization methods suggest that the optimal story stiffness is largest at the base and decreases as you move up the structure.
